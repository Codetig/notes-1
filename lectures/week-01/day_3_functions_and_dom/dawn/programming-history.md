##Ancient Computers

[Abacus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) — Babylon, 2400 BC. Earliest known tool for computation. 

[Antikythera Mechanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) — Greece, 205 BCE. First mechanical analog computer, purposed for astronomy.

##The Beginnings of Programming
[**Ada Lovelace**](https://www.sdsc.edu/ScienceWomen/lovelace.html):
1815 - 1852

A British mathematician regarded as being the first computer programmer. She wrote out algorithms for Charles Babbage's [Analytical Engine's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine) design, the first general-purpose computer that could be described as Turing-complete.

Though her programs were not implemented, her most famous work is describing the "plan" that could instruct a computer to calculate [Bernoulli numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number). 

Self described her work as "poetical science" and first coined the term "library".

##Modern Computers

Not until WWII would the first true computers be created. The argument for which came first depends on how you define a computer. Here were some of the earliest computers:

[Z1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z1_%28computer%29) - Germany, 1936. First programmable computer.

[Colossus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer) — Britain, 1943. First electric programmable computer.

[ENIAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC) — USA, 1946. First digital computer.

##Initial Programming Languages

Limitations of speed and memory forced programmer to write in [assembly language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language), so higher level languages evolved in order to reduce errors and increase expressiveness.

[Plankalkül](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankalk%C3%BCl) — Germany, 1948. First high-level programming language.

[A-0]() — Remington Rand, 1952. [Grace Hopper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) invented the compiler and enabled A-0 to be the first [compiled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language) language.

[FORTRAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) & [COBOL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL) — IBM & Department of Defense, late '50s. More advanced and universal compiled languages.

[LISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) — MIT, 1958. Second oldest compiled language and one of the first [functional](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) languages. It has been the preferred choice for those in field of AI. It has spawned many "dialects" that are still in use today.

[BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) — Dartmouth, 1964. A high-level language that emphasized ease of use for mass distribution on microcomputers. It still exists in part today in [Visual Basic .NET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET).

[C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) — AT&T Bell Labs, 1969. A prolific language due in part to it's implementation into [UNIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and a set standardization by the American National Standards Institute.

##Modern Computer Languages

[C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [C#](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29), [Objective-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) — AT&T Bell Labs, Microsoft, Apple, mid 80s. Different flavors of C that build upon the the language's core components.

[Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) - Sun Microsystems, 1995. Enabled programs to run on virtually any computer hardware via the [Java Virtual Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine), which facilitated much of the early growth of the internet.

[Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29), [Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29), & [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) — Individuals, mid 90s. Very high-level, general-purpose, scripting languages.

[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) aka ECMAscript — Netscape, 1995. The linga-franca of the browser. Not explicitly related to Java. Apparently designed in 10 days; it has come a long way since its inception.
