#Express

##Objectives

* Initialize an express app (20m)
* Pull information out of the req object (30m)
* Build a calculator app (30m)


##Work flow

* Work with the person sitting next to you, you guys will **pair program**
* The person whose name is alphabetically first will navigate first.

##Pair programming

* The navigator must have their computer closed.
* The driver is the only touching the computer.
* We will switch roles every 10m.
* Switching will involve the previous driver pushing to github and the previous navigator pulling down the changes. Do this every time you switch.
  

##Setup

#####Local project directory
`mkdir learningExpress`, `cd` into it & `git init`

#####Remote project repository
On [GitHub](http://www.github.com) 

#####Add


Install express globally: `npm install express`. Installing it globally allows us to use it as a CLI to generate apps.

##Notes

#####Picking partners
Standup hand-up: high-five someone, they are your partner! Partner from a diff table. Then have them make a repo together.

#####Checkins

Either choose pair to present solution

*or*

list of pain points and call on students to address them & give color

#####Timing

* Intro 10m — pair programming guidelines
* Init app — 10m work & 5m discussion
* Req obj — 20m & 10m
* Break - 10m
* Cal app — 20m & 10m 

* 85m total



#####Framing

Frame that the last exercise may not be complete
