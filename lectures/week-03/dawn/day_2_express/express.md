#Express

##Objectives

* Initialize an express app
* Pull information out of the req object
* Build a calculator app


##Work flow

* Work with the person sitting next to you, you guys will **pair program**
* The person whose name is alphabetically first will navigate first.

##Pair programming

* The navigator must have their computer closed.
* The driver is the only touching the computer.
* We will switch roles every 15m.
* Switching will involve the previous driver pushing to github and the previous navigator pulling down the changes. Do this every time you switch.
